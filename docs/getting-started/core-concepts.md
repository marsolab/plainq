# Core concepts

This page explains the model behind PlainQ: what a queue is, what happens to a
message from send to acknowledgment, and the knobs that govern its lifecycle.
Read it once and the rest of the docs will click into place.

## Queues

A **queue** is a named, durable collection of messages. Each queue has:

- a **name** (what you pass to `plainq create`), and
- an immutable **queue ID** — an [XID](https://github.com/rs/xid) like
  `cf9k2m3p8q1r4s5t6u7v`, returned when the queue is created. Most CLI and API
  operations take the **ID**, not the name.

Queues are independent: messages in one queue never appear in another (the one
exception is a [dead-letter queue](#eviction-and-dead-letter-queues), which is
just another queue you nominate).

Internally each queue is backed by its own storage table, which keeps queues
isolated and makes purging and deleting cheap.

## Messages

A **message** is an opaque blob of bytes plus a generated message ID. PlainQ
does not inspect, parse, or transform the body — JSON, protobuf, plain text,
compressed bytes, it's all the same to the server. Keep messages reasonably
small and put large payloads in object storage with a pointer in the message.

## The message lifecycle

PlainQ implements the classic **competing-consumers** queue with at-least-once
delivery:

```
   Send                 Receive                    Delete
    │                     │                          │
    ▼                     ▼                          ▼
 ┌──────┐   visible   ┌──────────┐   timeout    ┌──────────┐
 │ NEW  │ ──────────▶ │ IN-FLIGHT │ ──────────▶ │ VISIBLE  │ ──▶ (loop)
 └──────┘             └──────────┘  (not acked)  └──────────┘
                           │
                           │ Delete (ack)
                           ▼
                       ┌────────┐
                       │ REMOVED │
                       └────────┘
```

1. **Send.** A producer enqueues a message. It is immediately visible.
2. **Receive.** A consumer requests a batch. Each returned message is made
   **invisible** for the queue's *visibility timeout*, and its *receive count*
   is incremented. While invisible, no other consumer can receive it.
3. **Process.** The consumer does its work.
4. **Delete (acknowledge).** The consumer deletes the message by ID. This is the
   acknowledgment — the message is gone for good.

If step 4 never happens (the consumer crashed, timed out, or simply didn't
delete), the visibility timeout expires and the message becomes **visible
again**, ready to be redelivered. That's what "at-least-once" means: a message
is delivered until someone acknowledges it.

> The CLI's `plainq receive` intentionally does **not** auto-delete. That's why
> running it twice within the visibility window hides the message, and running it
> again after the window returns the same message. Real consumers call `Delete`
> after successful processing.

### Ordering

Within a single queue, messages are delivered in **FIFO order** by creation time
(`ORDER BY created_at`). This is best-effort FIFO, not a strict global total
order guarantee across concurrent producers, and redelivered messages naturally
move later in time. There is **no deduplication** — sending the same body twice
creates two independent messages.

## The four lifecycle knobs

Every queue is configured with four settings at creation time. They are the heart
of PlainQ's behavior.

| Setting                   | CLI flag                  | Default     | Controls                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Visibility timeout        | `--visibility-timeout`    | `30` (s)    | How long a received message stays invisible.          |
| Max receive attempts      | `--max-receive-attempts`  | `5`         | How many times a message can be received before eviction. |
| Retention period          | `--retention-period`      | `7 days`*   | How long a message can live before eviction.          |
| Eviction policy           | `--drop-policy`           | `drop`      | What happens on eviction: drop, or dead-letter.       |

\* The CLI passes `0` for retention by default, which the server interprets as
its built-in default of **7 days** (604,800 seconds).

### Visibility timeout

The window a message is hidden after being received. Set it to comfortably
exceed your processing time:

- **Too short** → the message reappears and gets processed twice while the first
  worker is still busy.
- **Too long** → if a worker dies, the message sits invisible for a long time
  before another worker can retry it.

### Max receive attempts

A *poison message* — one that always fails processing — would otherwise loop
forever. Each receive bumps the message's retry counter; once it exceeds
`max_receive_attempts`, the message becomes eligible for **eviction**.

### Retention period

An upper bound on a message's lifetime regardless of retries. After
`created_at + retention_period`, the message becomes eligible for eviction even
if it was never received. Use it to keep stale data from accumulating.

### Eviction and dead-letter queues

When a message exceeds its retry budget *or* its retention period, the
**eviction policy** decides its fate:

- **`drop`** (default) — the message is permanently deleted.
- **`dead-letter`** — the message is moved to another queue you nominate with
  `--dead-letter-queue-id`. This lets you inspect, alert on, and replay failures
  instead of losing them.

Eviction is performed by a background **garbage-collection sweep** (every ~30
minutes by default), not instantly at the moment a threshold is crossed. So a
message that just exhausted its retries may linger briefly until the next sweep.

> The protobuf schema also defines a `REORDER` eviction policy, but it is not
> implemented. Use `drop` or `dead-letter`.

[Queues & messages](../guides/queues-and-messages.md).

## Interfaces

PlainQ exposes the same queue model through several surfaces:

- **gRPC API** (`:8080`) — the canonical wire protocol; the CLI is a thin client
  over it. Queue/message RPCs and six stable pub/sub RPCs share the same
  application behavior. See the
  [gRPC API guide](../guides/grpc-api.md).
- **CLI** (`plainq <command>`) — interactive and scriptable. See the
  [CLI guide](../guides/cli.md).
- **Houston** (`:8081`) — the web admin UI for queues, accounts, RBAC, and
  metrics. See the [Houston guide](../guides/houston.md).
- **HTTP REST** (`:8081`) — stable topic/subscription routes plus account/auth,
  RBAC, OAuth, onboarding, and the metrics API used by Houston.

## Storage backends

PlainQ runs on one of two backends, chosen with `--storage.driver`:

- **SQLite** (default) — an embedded file at `./plainq.db`. Small, fast, zero
  dependencies, and a natural fit for [Litestream](https://litestream.io)
  replication. Ideal for local development and single-node deployments.
- **PostgreSQL** — a shared backend when you want multiple server instances to
  talk to the same data. Set `--storage.driver=postgres` and
  `--storage.postgres.dsn=...`.

The queue model and semantics are identical across both. See
[Deployment](../guides/deployment.md) for guidance on choosing.

## Authentication model

PlainQ has authentication and RBAC built in, not bolted on:

- PlainQ ships a JWT session subsystem (access + refresh tokens), role-based
  authorization, per-queue permissions, and a first-run **onboarding** flow to
  create the initial admin. Houston uses these for its login.
- External identity providers (Kinde, Auth0, Okta, WorkOS) plug in via OAuth/OIDC,
  with optional organization and team multi-tenancy.

> **Security boundary:** when authentication is enabled, the HTTP topic subtree
> and authenticated admin routes use bearer sessions. PlainQ does not make
> per-topic or per-queue authorization decisions, and the gRPC listener has no
> built-in authentication. Do not treat a session as tenant isolation; see
> [Deployment → network exposure](../guides/deployment.md#network-exposure).

See [Authentication & RBAC](../authentication-rbac.md) and
[OAuth, organizations & teams](../oauth-organizations-teams.md).
